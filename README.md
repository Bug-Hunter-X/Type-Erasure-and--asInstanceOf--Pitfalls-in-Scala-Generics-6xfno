This example demonstrates a subtle bug that can arise from Scala's type erasure in conjunction with pattern matching and unsafe type casts using `asInstanceOf`. The `MyClass` utilizes pattern matching with `asInstanceOf` to handle String type differently, causing issues when this behavior is not well-understood and handled with better type safety.  The solution demonstrates a safer approach using type classes or other techniques to achieve similar results without unsafe casts.
